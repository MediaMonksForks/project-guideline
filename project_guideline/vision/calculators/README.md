This directory contains MediaPipe calculators that can be used as part of a
MediaPipe graph for performing image segmentation, depth estimation and
alignment, and occupancy map computation.

These are a work in progress and not currently integrated with Guideline. They
are intended to eventually replace parts of Guideline with a MediaPipe graph.
